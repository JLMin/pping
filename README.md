# pyping

## Implemented '**ping**' command by using python.

This little program contains three files:

- \_packet.py

> This module is responsible for create a ICMP ping packet and unpack recived packet.

- ping.py

> This module is responsible for sending and reciving packets.

- util.py

> This module provides some examples of how to manipulate the resulting data.

Also there are 2 example scrpits to show case how to use this program.
